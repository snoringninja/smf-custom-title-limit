Custom Title Limit for SMF 2.0.x
===
###### By: [Snoring Ninja](https://snoring.ninja)
### Set a limit on custom title length

#### There are two different versions of this mod:
* CustomTitleDB
* CustomTitleNoDB

#### CustomTitleDB
When the mod is installed, it will clear out any currently set custom titles so that limits so that the users have to re-add them and follow the enforced limit

#### CustomTitleNoDB
When the mod in installed, don't reset any currently set custom titles.  This technically means there could be custom titles longer than the requested limit set by the mod; however, if they try to edit their title after it would have to follow the enforced limit.
